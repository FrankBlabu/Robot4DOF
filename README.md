Code for the GearBest 4DOF robot

## Source code

This repository contains code necessary to bring the GearBest 4DOF robot (which does not seem to have a name) to life. 
While GearBest provides a step-by-step assembling instruction, there is neither information about how to wire the
controls (no shield provided) nor the arduino source code.

Well, programming the robot yourself is fun and this piece of code here might provide some information about how to do this.

Please note that both the source code and the wiring information comes without any warranty (see license). It worked here, 
but everything is experimental and largely untested.

See source code for wiring information.
